Current list of things to do along with the current open bugs:
update the kernel source to 3.4.103 patch in f2fs, backport governor fixes from the mainline. setup the ril files to work correctly with verizon, change from eng to userdebug
, move /data to an sdcard partition (will probably make flashable zip for that)
